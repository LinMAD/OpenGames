## FAQ

- **Visual studio configuration**
    - You can face down an issue with the building (missing links, symbols, etc.). Make sure you downloaded MSVC for desktop dev with C++
    - SFML 2.5.1 Requires platform toolset VS 2017 (v141) and check Windows SDK 10.0
- **Where sprites come from**
	- They made by me or I found them at https://www.spriters-resource.com/.
